## Specs
### User Stories

* As the salon owner, I need to be able to select a stylist, see their details, and see a list of all clients that belong to that stylist.
* As the salon owner, I need to add new stylists to our system when they are hired.
* As the salon owner, I need to be able to add new clients to a specific stylist. I should not be able to add a client if no stylists have been added.
